### Challenge (c) Masterschool

Write a script that asks the user to input numbers in a loop. 

The script will continuously calculate the sum of all the numbers typed.

When the sum reaches 1000 (or more), the loop will stop and the final sum will be printed.

### Edge Cases

You don’t need to check the validity of the input, assume the user always input integers.
